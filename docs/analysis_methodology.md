# Historical Weather Analysis Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to analyzing historical weather data from NASA Earth observation datasets to determine the likelihood of specific weather conditions for user-specified locations and times of year.

## Data Sources

### NASA Earth Observation Data

Our primary sources are NASA's Earth observation datasets:

1. **MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)**
   - Temperature data
   - Spatial resolution: 1km
   - Temporal resolution: Daily
   - Years available: 2000-present

2. **GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement)**
   - Precipitation data
   - Spatial resolution: 10km
   - Temporal resolution: 30-minute
   - Years available: 2014-present

3. **MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications)**
   - Comprehensive weather variables (temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity)
   - Spatial resolution: 0.5° x 0.625°
   - Temporal resolution: Hourly
   - Years available: 1980-present

4. **POWER (Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources)**
   - Solar radiation and meteorological data
   - Spatial resolution: 0.5° x 0.5°
   - Temporal resolution: Daily
   - Years available: 1981-present

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection

- Extract data from NASA Earth observation datasets using the AI-Agent-Scraper tool
- Focus on parameters relevant to condition identification (temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity)
- Organize by location (latitude/longitude) and date

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Standardize units across datasets (°C for temperature, mm for precipitation, km/h for wind speed)
- Handle missing values through interpolation or statistical techniques
- Convert timestamps to standard format and extract day of year for seasonal analysis
- Apply quality control measures to remove anomalous readings

### 3. Historical Pattern Analysis

- Aggregate data by location and day of year
- Calculate statistical measures (mean, min, max, standard deviation) for each variable
- Identify patterns in historical data for each location and day of year
- Establish thresholds for different weather conditions:
  - "Very hot": Temperature exceeds local 90th percentile or absolute threshold
  - "Very cold": Temperature below local 10th percentile or absolute threshold
  - "Very windy": Wind speed exceeds local 90th percentile or absolute threshold
  - "Very wet": Precipitation exceeds local 90th percentile or absolute threshold
  - "Very uncomfortable": Discomfort index exceeds threshold (based on temperature and humidity)

### 4. Probability Calculation

- Calculate historical frequencies for each condition
- Convert frequencies to probability estimates
- Compute confidence intervals for probabilities
- Identify correlations between different conditions (e.g., hot and wet, cold and windy)

## Statistical Models

### Condition Probability Models

For each weather condition, we develop a dedicated model:

1. **VeryHotConditionModel**
   - Inputs: Location, day of year, historical temperature data
   - Output: Probability of "very hot" conditions
   - Threshold: Location-specific or absolute (e.g., 35°C)

2. **VeryColdConditionModel**
   - Inputs: Location, day of year, historical temperature data
   - Output: Probability of "very cold" conditions
   - Threshold: Location-specific or absolute (e.g., 0°C)

3. **VeryWindyConditionModel**
   - Inputs: Location, day of year, historical wind data
   - Output: Probability of "very windy" conditions
   - Threshold: Location-specific or absolute (e.g., 30 km/h)

4. **VeryWetConditionModel**
   - Inputs: Location, day of year, historical precipitation data
   - Output: Probability of "very wet" conditions
   - Threshold: Location-specific or absolute (e.g., 10mm)

5. **VeryUncomfortableConditionModel**
   - Inputs: Location, day of year, historical temperature and humidity data
   - Output: Probability of "very uncomfortable" conditions
   - Metric: Heat index or discomfort index (combining temperature and humidity)

### Model Validation

- Cross-validation using historical data
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confidence interval calculation for probability estimates
- Sensitivity analysis for threshold values
