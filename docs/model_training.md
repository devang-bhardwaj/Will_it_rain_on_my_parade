# Model Training Documentation

This document outlines the approach for training our weather prediction models for the "Will it rain on my parade?" project.

## Model Architecture

We will implement multiple model architectures to compare performance:

1. **Baseline Models**
   - Random Forest Regressor/Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

2. **Deep Learning Models**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial data
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal patterns
   - Transformer models for sequence prediction

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - CNN-LSTM for spatiotemporal data
   - Attention mechanisms with traditional forecasting models

## Features

### Meteorological Features
- Temperature (surface and various altitudes)
- Humidity (relative and specific)
- Air pressure (sea level and station)
- Wind speed and direction
- Cloud coverage and type
- Precipitation history

### Geographical Features
- Elevation
- Land cover type
- Distance to water bodies
- Terrain ruggedness
- Urban heat island effects

### Temporal Features
- Time of day
- Day of year
- Season
- Historical weather patterns

### Satellite-Derived Features
- Cloud optical thickness
- Water vapor concentration
- Aerosol optical depth
- Land surface temperature

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values through imputation or interpolation
   - Remove outliers based on domain knowledge and statistical methods
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create lag features for time-series data
   - Calculate rolling statistics (mean, variance over different time windows)
   - Generate cyclical features for time components
   - Extract spatial patterns and gradients

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Feature importance selection from tree-based models
   - Auto-encoder based feature extraction for high-dimensional data

## Training Process

### Dataset Split
- Temporal split (train on past, validate on more recent data)
- Spatial split (train on certain locations, validate on others)
- Standard random split with stratification

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search for baseline models
- Bayesian optimization for deep learning models
- Cross-validation with appropriate temporal constraints

### Training Infrastructure
- Local development for prototyping
- Possible cloud computing for final model training
- GPU acceleration for deep learning models

## Evaluation Metrics

### For Precipitation Prediction
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)

### For Rain Classification
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC)
- Brier Score

### For User Experience
- Prediction lead time
- Spatial resolution accuracy
- Temporal accuracy (when will it rain, not just if)

## Model Deployment

### Model Export
- ONNX format for cross-platform compatibility
- TensorFlow SavedModel for TensorFlow models
- Pickle for scikit-learn models

### Serving Strategy
- RESTful API using FastAPI
- Containerization with Docker
- Batch prediction capability for offline analysis

## Continuous Improvement

- A/B testing of model versions
- Periodic retraining with new data
- Monitoring of model drift and performance degradation
- Feedback loop from user corrections and reports

## Ethical Considerations

- Transparency in prediction confidence
- Clear communication of limitations
- Regional bias mitigation
- Resource efficiency in computation
