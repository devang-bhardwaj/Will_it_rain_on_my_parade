**NASA Space Apps Challenge Entry - Weather Prediction for Outdoor Events**> A weather prediction system for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025



A focused, streamlined weather prediction system that helps users determine if weather conditions will be suitable for outdoor events.## Project Overview & Progress Tracking Document



## 🎯 Challenge FocusThis repository contains our team's solution for the "Will It Rain On My Parade?" challenge as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. Our project aims to develop a system for analyzing historical weather data to determine the likelihood of various weather conditions for specific locations and times, enabling users to plan their outdoor events accordingly.



Predicts **5 key weather conditions** that can ruin outdoor events:### Challenge Details

- ☀️ **Very Hot** (35°C+ temperatures)

- 🥶 **Very Cold** (-5°C or lower)**Event Date**: October 4-5, 2025

- 💨 **Very Windy** (8+ m/s winds)

- 🌧️ **Very Wet** (10+ mm precipitation)**Challenge Difficulty**: Intermediate

- 😰 **Very Uncomfortable** (high heat index or extreme conditions)

**Challenge Subjects**: Coding, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Forecasting, Software, Weather, Web Development

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Challenge Summary**:

### 1. Install Dependencies> If you're planning an outdoor event—like a vacation, a hike on a trail, or fishing on a lake—it would be good to know the chances of adverse weather for the time and location you are considering. There are many types of Earth observation data that can provide information on weather conditions for a particular location and day of the year. Your challenge is to construct an app with a personalized interface that enables users to conduct a customized query to tell them the likelihood of "very hot," "very cold," "very windy," "very wet," or "very uncomfortable" conditions for the location and time they specify.

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt**Challenge Objectives**:

```

- Develop an application using NASA Earth observation data for historical weather analysis

### 2. Run the System- Create a personalized dashboard for users to query weather condition probabilities

```bash- Allow users to specify locations and times (day of the year) for queries

python main.py- Provide visualizations and statistics about the likelihood of specific weather conditions

```- Include options for data download in formats like CSV or JSON
